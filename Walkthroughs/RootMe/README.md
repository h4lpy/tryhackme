## Walkthrough

Running an initial scan against all ports shows ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open.

```console
$ nmap -p- -T4 <VICTIM IP> -oN scans/initial.nmap
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-21 22:47 GMT
Nmap scan report for <VICTIM IP>
Host is up (0.032s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 16.79 seconds
```

Running a full scan against these ports show Apache version `2.4.29` is running on an Ubuntu system:

```console
$ nmap -p 22,80 -T4 -A <VICTIM IP> -oN scans/open_ports.nmap
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-21 22:49 GMT
Nmap scan report for <VICTIM IP>
Host is up (0.031s latency).

Navigating to the website shows a basic terminal prompt design:

![RootMe - Homepage](/images/rootme_homepage.png)

Running GoBuster identifies an `/uploads` and a `/panel` directory:

```console
$ gobuster dir -u http://<VICTIM IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

![RootMe - Hidden Directory](/images/rootme_hidden_directory.png)

Navigating to `/panel` shows an upload form:

![RootMe - Upload Form](/images/rootme_upload_form.png)

Trying to upload a [PHP reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell) errors out, as follows:

![RootMe - PHP Invalid](/images/rootme_php_invalid.png)

Changing the file extension from `.php` to `.php5` manages to succeed:

![RootMe - PHP5 Valid](/images/rootme_php5_valid.png)

Navigating to `/uploads/php-reverse-shell.php5`, we receive a callback on our Netcat listener as the `www-data` user:

![RootMe - Callback](/images/rootme_callback.png)

Manually crawling through the filesystem yields a `user.txt` in `/var/www`:

![RootMe - User.txt](/images/rootme_user_txt.png)

Looking for files with the SUID bit set finds `/usr/bin/python`:

```console
$ find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

![RootMe - SUID Python](/images/rootme_setuid_python.png)

Can run the [GTFOBin](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#suid) for Python SUID to escalate privileges and get the `root.txt` flag:

## Reconnaissance

1. Scan the machine, how many ports are open?

```
2
```

2. What version of Apache is running?

```
2.4.29
```

3. What service is running on port 22?

```
SSH
```

4. Find directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool.

```
No answer needed
```

5. What is the hidden directory?

```
/panel/
```

## Getting a Shell

1. user.txt

```
THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}
```

## Privilege Escalation

1. Search for files with SUID permissions, which file is weird?

```
/usr/bin/python
```

2. Find a form to escalate your privileges.

```
No answer needed
```

3. root.txt

```
THM{pr1v1l3g3_3sc4l4t10n}
```
